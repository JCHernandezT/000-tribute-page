						<h3 id="subtitle">Here's a timeline of Sir Tim Berners-Lee life:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>1955</strong> - Born in London England, UK.</li>
							<li><strong>1976</strong> - After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset..</li>
							<li><strong>1978</strong> - He joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for printers.</li>
							<li><strong>1980</strong> - Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the 
							concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system 
							named ENQUIRE. After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset. 
							He ran the company's technical side for three years.[26] The project he worked on was a "real-time remote procedure call" which gave him 
							experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow</li>
							<li><strong>1989</strong> - In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext 
							with the Internet. Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989.</li>
							<li><strong>1990</strong> - He redistributed his proposal. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall. He used similar ideas to 
							those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built  the first Web browser.</li>
							<li><strong>1991</strong> - The <a href="http://info.cern.ch">first web site</a> built was at CERN within the border of France and was put online on 6 August 1991 for the first time:.</li>
							<li><strong>1994</strong> -  Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies 
							that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, 
							with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, 
							so that they easily could be adopted by anyone.</li>
							<li><strong>2001</strong> - Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset.</li>
							<li><strong>2004</strong> - He accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web.</li>
							<li><strong>2009</strong> - Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation in order to "advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change."</li>
							<li><strong>2013</strong> -  Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Facebook, 
							Intel, and Microsoft. The A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where 
							only 31% of people are online. Berners-Lee will work with those aiming to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the UN 
							Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.</li>
							<li><strong>2016</strong> - Berners-Lee holds the founders chair in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where 
							he heads the Decentralized Information Group and is leading Solid, a joint project with the Qatar Computing Research Institute that aims 
							to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. In October 2016, 
							he joined the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University as a professor and as a fellow of Christ Church, one of the Oxford 
							colleges.</li>
